This project focuses on the design and optimization of a communication network using Primâ€™s algorithm, 
a well-known graph-based algorithm for finding the minimum spanning tree (MST) of a weighted 
undirected graph. 

The project aims to demonstrate how Prim's algorithm can be utilized to create an efficient and cost- 
effective communication network topology, minimizing the overall construction and Maintenance expenses 
While ensuring reliable connectivity.
